# Genetic Algorithm

Genetic Algorithm (GA) uses a process of evolution and naturalselection theory to solve complex artificial search problems, andis part of evolutionary computing algorithms. Here, we implemeted the GA to solve the Richardson arm race model and find optimal parameters.

## OuickStart

To use the implemented GA for Richardson arm race model, please use following cmd to clone the code:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/Mihir3009/genetic-algorithm.git
```

### Setup Environment

1. python3.6 <br /> Reference to download and install : https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-360/
2. Install requirements <br /> 
```
> pip install -r requirements.txt

```
